			<p>
				Networking is a wired or wireless connection between two devices which allows them to interact and share data with each other. Having a secure network is necessary so as to  protect ourselves from malicoius softwares, also called malwares. Usage of firewall is the best way to do this.
				Once we connect to a network, we become visible to the users of the network so it is advisable to have a security system so that your personal data in your computer is not breached or tampered with. Antiviruses are available so that a file can be scanned when it is added to the computer via the internet or directly so that any virus hidden in a software can be removed before caussing harm.
